GeoMesa NiFi Bundle
===================

NiFi manages large batches and streams of files and data.
GeoMesa-NiFi allows you to ingest data into GeoMesa straight from NiFi by
leveraging custom processors.

Installation
------------

### Install the Processors

Pick a reasonable directory on your machine, and run:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/geomesa/geomesa-nifi.git
$ cd geomesa-nifi
```

To build, run

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

To install the GeoMesa processors you will need to copy the geomesa-nifi-nar file from
``geomesa-nifi/geomesa-nifi-nar/target/geomesa-nifi-nar-$VERSION.nar`` into the ``lib/`` directory of your NiFi installation.

### Install the SFTs and Converters

The GeoMesa processors need access to the SFTs and converters in order to ingest data. There are two ways of providing these
to the processors. We can enter the SFT specification string and converter specification string directly in a processor or we can 
provide these to the processors by placing the SFTs and converters in a file named ``reference.conf`` and then putting that file on the
classpath. This can be achieved by wrapping this file in a JAR and placing it in the ``lib/`` directory of the NiFi
installation. For example you can wrap the ``reference.conf`` file in a JAR with this command.

```bash
$ jar cvf data-formats.jar reference.conf
```

To validate everything is correct, run this command. Your results should be similar.

```bash
$ jar tvf data-formats.jar

```

Processors
----------

This project contains four processors:

* ``PutGeoMesa``       - Ingest data into GeoMesa Accumulo with a GeoMesa converter or from geoavro
* ``PutGeoMesaKafka``  - Ingest data into GeoMesa Kafka with a GeoMesa converter or from geoavro
* ``PutGeoTools``      - Ingest data into an arbitrary GeoTools Datastore based on parameters using a GeoMesa converter or avro
* ``ConvertToGeoAvro`` - Use a GeoMesa converter to create geoavro

### PutGeoMesa

The ``PutGeoMesa`` processor is used for ingesting data into an Accumulo backed GeoMesa datastore. To use this processor
first add it to the workspace and open the properties tab of its configuration. Descriptions of the properties are
given below:

useMock                       | Use a mock instance of Accumulo
GeoMesa Configuration Service | Configuration service to use. More about this feature below.

#### GeoMesa Configuration Service

The ``PutGeoMesa`` plugin supports [NiFi Controller Services](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html)
to manage common configurations. This allows the user to specify a single location to store the Accumulo connection parameters.
This allows you to add new PutGeoMesa processors without having to enter duplicate data.

To add the ``GeomesaConfigControllerService`` access the ``Contoller Settings`` from NiFi global menu and navigate to the
``ControllerServices`` tab and click the ``+`` to add a new service. Search for the ``GeomesaConfigControllerService``
and click add. Edit the new service and enter the appropriate values for the properties listed.

To use this feature, after configuring the service, select the appropriate Geomesa Config Controller Service from the drop down
of the ``GeoMesa Configuration Service`` property. When a controller service is selected the ``zookeepers``, ``instanceId``,
``user``, ``password`` and ``tableName`` parameters are not required or used.

### PutGeoMesaKafka

The ``PutGeoMesaKafka`` processor is used for ingesting data into a Kafka backed GeoMesa datastore. This processor only supports Kafka 0.9
and newer. To use this processor first add it to the workspace and open the properties tab of its configuration. Descriptions of the

along as a flow to be used by other processors in NiFi. To use this processor first add it to the workspace and open
the properties tab of its configuration. Descriptions of the properties are given below:
